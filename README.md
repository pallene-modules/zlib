# zlib

This is currently a wrapper around LuaPower's `zlib_h` to provide a more useful object-orientated API suitable for use with streamed libcurl downloads. It requires [halimede](https://github.com/pallene/halimede). Documentation is intentionally not provided at this time as the API is extremely unstable.

The license is MIT.
